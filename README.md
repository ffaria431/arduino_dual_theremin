# Dual-Ultrasonic Theremin with Adaptive Signal Processing and Scale Quantization  

## Objectives  
The objective of this project is to design and implement a **gesture-controlled electronic musical instrument**, inspired by the classical theremin, using **dual ultrasonic sensors** and an **Arduino Uno**. Unlike a simple pitch‚Äìdistance mapping, this implementation integrates signal processing and music theory concepts to provide a more rigorous and musically coherent experience. Specifically, the project aims to:  

- Demonstrate contactless musical control using ultrasonic distance sensors.  
- Apply **moving average filtering** to reduce noise in sensor readings.  
- Implement **logarithmic pitch mapping** to mimic human auditory perception.  
- Apply **scale quantization** to restrict pitches to predefined musical scales (e.g., C major).  
- Map a second ultrasonic sensor to control amplitude (volume) with perceptual scaling.  
- Provide opportunities for extensions, including octave shifting, scale selection, and LED-based visual feedback.

## Project Overview  
This project extends the concept of a theremin by using two HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors:  

- **Pitch Sensor:** Controls the musical note frequency based on hand distance.  
- **Volume Sensor:** Controls loudness by mapping hand distance to PWM duty cycle.  

The raw distance data is inherently noisy; therefore, a **moving average filter** is applied for smoothing. The filtered pitch values are mapped **logarithmically** to approximate human hearing, and then **quantized** to a musical scale to ensure harmonic output.  

The system outputs sound through a piezo buzzer or speaker, while an optional LED provides a real-time visual indicator of amplitude. Data from both sensors, the quantized note frequency, and the mapped duty cycle are continuously streamed to the Arduino Serial Plotter for real-time visualization.

## Working Principle  
The dual-ultrasonic theremin operates by combining gesture sensing, signal processing, and musical quantization into a cohesive system. Each ultrasonic sensor detects the distance of a hand placed above it: the first sensor governs pitch while the second controls volume. Since ultrasonic measurements are inherently noisy, the raw readings are stabilized using a moving average filter. The filtered pitch distance is then transformed into a musical frequency using a logarithmic mapping, ensuring perceptual realism by aligning pitch transitions with human auditory sensitivity. To enforce harmonic consistency, the mapped frequency is quantized to the nearest note in a predefined scale (e.g., C major), thereby restricting the instrument to musically consonant tones. Simultaneously, the second sensor determines amplitude by mapping distance to PWM duty cycle with a perceptual scaling function, allowing closer hand positions to produce louder outputs. The Arduino generates the quantized pitch via the piezo buzzer, while the LED (if connected) provides visual feedback proportional to amplitude. Additionally, the system streams pitch distance, volume distance, quantized frequency, and duty cycle values to the Arduino Serial Plotter, enabling real-time visualization of the theremin‚Äôs behavior.
